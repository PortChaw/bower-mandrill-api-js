bower-mandrill-api-js
=====================

Bower package for [Mandrill's JavaScript API](https://bitbucket.org/mailchimp/mandrill-api-js)

To install run the following

    bower install mandrill-api

**Caution:** I wouldn't use this in production unless your javascript code is behind authentication of some kind as this library requires that you store your api key in the client javascript.
